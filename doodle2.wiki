== doodle - A minimal game 'framework'.

[[toc:]]

=== Description

A minimal game 'framework' inspired by [[http://love2d.org/|l√∂ve]].

'''This is still a work in progress and subject to change!'''

=== Author

[[/users/christian-kellermann|Christian Kellermann]]

=== Requirements

Requires the [[miscmacros]], [[cairo]] and [[sdl]] extensions.

=== General program flow of a doodle

A program creates a window, called a 'doodle' here and registers for
any of these three events: world-inits, world-ends and
world-changes. world-inits is called upon the first iteration of the
event loop, world-ends last and world-changes for every iteration.

world-inits and world-ends are thunks, whereas world-changes has the
following signature:

<procedure>(world-changes (lambda (event dt escape-continuation) ...)</procedure>

; event : holds the occured event of this loop iteration
; dt : holds the time delta between the last and this iteration
; escape-continuation : holds the continuation that will exit the loop

Please see below for a detailed list of supported {{event}} symbols.

{{dt}} is a flonum which can be used to adjust speed of animations for
example.

The game loop is started with the {{(run-event-loop)}} procedure.
Usually the game loop will run as fast as it can unless the keyword
parameter {{minimum-wait}} has been given which adds that minimum
delay between iterations.

=== API Documentation

This egg is still under development; the API might change a bit in
future versions.

==== Event loop
===== Procedures
<procedure>(run-event-loop #!key (run-in-background #f) (minimum-wait 0))</procedure>

Starts the event loop and runs {{world-inits}}. If
{{run-in-background}} is #t a new thread is started. Within the event
loop the procedure given with {{world-changes}} is called with the
time delta of the last call and the events that occured. If
{{minimum-wait}} is given and the delta is smaller than
{{minimum-wait}} the thread will sleep for the remaining
time. {{minimum-wait}} takes a value in milliseconds.

===== Parameters
<parameter>(world-inits (lambda () ...))</parameter>

A thunk that is called once when the event loop is started.

<parameter>(world-ends (lambda () ...))</parameter>

A thunk that is called once when the even loop is exited.

<parameter>(world-changes (lambda (event dt exit-continuation) ...))</parameter>

A procedure that gets called every iteration of the event loop. The
{{event}} parameter holds the event, {{dt}} is the time difference in
milliseconds between the last and current
iteration. {{exit-continuation}} can be used to jump out of the
event-loop.

===== Events

One event is a list containing information about the individual
event. There are currently 3 types of handled events:

; quit : The quit event has the following form {{(quit)}}.
; key events : The first element of the list is either the symbol {{pressed}} or {{released}} followed by either the integer for the key code or the symbols {{up}}, {{down}}, {{left}} or {{right}} representing cursor keys.
; unknown : This will list all other events. The list contains the symbol {{unknown}} and the SDL event type. See the SDL egg documentation for hints on what this may be.

==== Drawing
===== Colors

Colors in doodle are represented as simple lists representing RGBA
values one number each. Currently there are two predefined colors:

; solid-black : {{(0 0 0 1)}}
; solid-white : {{(1 1 1 1)}}

===== Procedures

<procedure>(new-doodle #!key (width 680) (height 460) (title "Doodle") (background solid-black) (fullscreen #f))</procedure>

Initialises the internal state and createas a window with the given
dimensions and title.

The background parameter can either be a doodle RGBA color list or a
string pointing to a PNG file.

<procedure>(show!)</procedure>

Causes a redraw of the window.

<procedure>(clear-screen! #!optional (color (current-background)))</procedure>

Fills the screen with the {{current-background}} color. Color can
also be given as a string representing a filename to a PNG image which
will be loaded instead.

<procedure>(rectangle x y width height color)</procedure>

Draws a rectangle at the given coordinates {{(x, y)}} with the
dimensions {{width}} and {{height}}. The border is drawn in {{color}}.

<procedure>(filled-rectangle x y width height color)</procedure>

Draws a rectangle at the given coordinates {{(x, y)}} with the
dimensions {{width}} and {{height}}. The border is drawn in
{{color}}. The rectangle also is filled with {{color}}.

<procedure>(circle x y diameter color)</procedure>

Draws a circle at the point defined by {{(x,y)}} with the given
{{diameter}} and {{color}}. The border is drawn in {{color}}.

<procedure>(filled-circle x y diameter color)</procedure>

Draws a circle at the point defined by {{(x,y)}} with the given
{{diameter}} and {{color}}. The border is drawn in {{color}}. The
circle is filled in {{color}} too.

<procedure>(draw-line x1 y1 x2 y2 #!key (color solid-white) (style #:solid))</procedure>

Draw a line between the two points {{(x1,y1)}} and {{(x2,y2)}} in the
given style. Valid {{style}}s are either {{#:solid}} (the default) or
{{#:dashed}} for dashed lines. The line is drawn in {{color}}.

<procedure>(set-font! font size color)</procedure>

Sets the font to {{font}}, given {{size}} and {{color}}. {{font}} is a
string representing the font's name. Every X11 TTF font is applicable.

<procedure>(text x y text #!key (align #:left))</procedure>

Print the given text in one line starting on point
{{(x,y)}}. Alignment can be changed with the {{align}}
parameter. Supported alignment values are {{#:left}}, {{#:center}} and
{{#:right}}.

<procedure>(save-screenshot filename)</procedure>

Saves the current screen content to a file called {{filename}} as a
portable network graphics (PNG). It is up to the user to provide an
appropriate extension to the filename.

===== Parameters

<parameter>(font-color)</parameter>

Holds the current font color.

<parameter>(font-size)</parameter>

Holds the current font-size.

<parameter>(current-background)</parameter>

Holds the current background color.

==== Collision detection
