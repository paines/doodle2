Welcome to doodle2 - A minimal 'framework' for your games, visualisations etc.

Doodle2 is written in CHICKEN scheme, which is available at
http://www.call-cc.org.

It abstracts simple graphic rountines and window handling on top of
SDL2 which should make visualisation tasks and exporting these
drawings as well as writing games more fun and easy.

doodle2 also provides a simple event loop model which has got its
inspiration from the LUA LÃ¶ve framework, making it easy to do
animations and move sprites around.

To install doodle2, clone this git repository and issues the commands:

$ SDL2_FLAGS="-I/usr/include/SDL2 -D_REENTRANT -w -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -lSDL2" chicken-install -s sdl2
$ chicken-install -s (inside the doodle2 directory)

Doodle is available under the BSD license, and therefor is doodle2, because all work is based upon it.
