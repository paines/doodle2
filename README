Welcome to doodle - A minimal 'framework' for your games, visualisations etc.

Doodle is written in CHICKEN scheme, which is available at
http://www.call-cc.org.

It abstracts simple graphic rountines and window handling on top of
cairo / SDL which should make visualisation tasks and exporting these
drawings as well as writing games more fun and easy.

doodle also provides a simple event loop model which has got its
inspiration from the LUA LÃ¶ve framework, making it easy to do
animations and move sprites around.

Doodle comes with an experimental sprite detection mechanism.

To install doodle you can use CHICKEN schemes chicken-install tool:

$ chicken-install doodle
